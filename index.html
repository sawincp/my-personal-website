      <details id="section1">
        <p>It has been described as "the chess game of racquet sports." It is a unique outdoor tennis game, generally played in cold weather, that requires the patience of a tortoise combined with the speed of a hare. It is a game in which raw power is not the ultimate weapon, but finesse and accuracy are rewarded. Primarily a doubles game, teamwork between partners is also an important feature. Platform Tennis, also known as paddle tennis, is played on a 20-foot-by-44-foot court, about one-third the size of a conventional tennis court, and is surrounded by 12-foot high "chicken wire" screens. These are located eight feet behind the base lines and five feet from the sidelines. Service lines are drawn in the same manner as tennis.</p>
